Pretty much everything in the picture is pre-specified and generated through an algorithm that puts it all together.\nA more interesting example is the winner of the 2022 Colorado State Fair Art Competition, Jason Allen, and his piece, “Théâtre D’opéra Spatial”. His piece was actually largely created by a text-to-picture AI called Midjourney, which is similar to DALL-E 2. This program works by giving the AI a prompt, and it generates a picture in about a minute. The pictures are not perfect, but Allen was able to remove the visual artifacts from the picture to create the winning piece. \nAnother Example of generative art comes from https://fronkonstin.com where one can generate some plant art that the color of change be changed. In my case, i changed the color of the plant to ‘darkorchid4’ which is a purple shade.\n\n\n\nPlant\n\n\nFinally, here is a graph that was created that is quite funny.\n\n\n\nFox News Pie\n\n\nThis graph wanted to show the percentage of voters that supported certain presidential candidates during the 2012 election. However, the figure choice is just abysmal. Giving Fox news the benefit of the doubt, we might say that the survey only asked if they supported the GOP candidates, not which one they supported over the other, thus allowing the total percentage to not be capped at 100%. That said, this would be better represented as a bar graph, that way you can display the tight race more accurately, as well as get a quick view as the most likely candidate. Putting the data into a pie chart confuses the general audience as it does not convey meaningful comparison between the candidates, as well as pie charts are generally capped at 100%. Therefore the data could be better represented as a bar graph instead of a pie chart."
